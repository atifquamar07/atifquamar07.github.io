Currently working on diffusion language models at Virginia University. Previously, at UC San Diego, I worked on introducing a new paradigm for reasoning in vision language models, and at Purdue University, my work was focused on inference-time alignment of language models. I also founded [Insituate](https://insituate.ai), where we shipped agentic systems to banks and judiciary. I earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Biosciences from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in) in 2024.

My research focuses on advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models and developing trustworthy AI systems that are aligned with human values. While LLMs are a primary focus, I am also open to exploring other areas that can meaningfully expand the capabilities of intelligent systems.

*I am currently looking for research opportunities in both academia (PhD) and industry for a 2026 start.*
